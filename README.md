# A* Pathfinding Algorithm :zap:

***Demo project** for my compsci class **2022***

I wrote this little program to be able to show how the A* pathfinding algorithm works in practice. The program may be a little slow, but it should work fine!

- Run with `Enter` key
- Black nodes are the obstacles
- Traces the optimal path in green
- Orange nodes show nodes that have been inspected
